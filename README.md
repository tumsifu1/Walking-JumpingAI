# Walking-JumpingAI
This project involves building a desktop application that distinguishes between 'walking' and 'jumping' using accelerometer data collected from a smartphone. 
The process includes collecting data, storing and pre-processing it, extracting features, training a logistic regression model, and deploying the final model in a desktop application. 
The team must visualize a few samples of their data, detect and remove outliers, extract a minimum of 10 features, train the model to classify the data, and deploy the final model in a desktop app.
